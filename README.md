# Santorini Server

This project is about replicating the board game [Santorini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini) as practice. The goal is to allow users to play this game with each other in real time, while enforcing game rules and timers. 

Other learning objectives include learning about web sockets in depth, creating matchmaking system, replaying game history, and general software modelling due to the complex extensions of the game.
