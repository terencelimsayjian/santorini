# Santorini Server

This project is about replicating the board gameEntity [Santorini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini) as practice. The goal is to allow users to play this gameEntity with each other in real time, while enforcing gameEntity rules and timers. 

Other learning objectives include learning about web sockets in depth, creating matchmaking system, replaying gameEntity history, and general software modelling due to the complex extensions of the gameEntity.
